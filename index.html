    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      Before my diagnosis with Type 1 Diabetes, life was full of curiosity and joy. Dolls were more than toys—they were companions, confidants, and a source of comfort during uncertain times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diagnosis was a turning point. It was scary and overwhelming, but I learned to channel my challenges into resilience. Dolls continued to inspire creativity and hope throughout this journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I share this journey through the <strong>Doll Revolution Exhibit</strong>, highlighting how play, imagination, and persistence can transform struggle into strength. It also showcases my journey to becoming a TEDx speaker, turning personal experience into inspiration for others.

    <h2>The Exhibit</h2>
    <p>
      The Doll Revolution Exhibit celebrates the role dolls played in my life—companions during uncertainty, tools for expression, and symbols of resilience. Each piece tells a story, from pre-diagnosis curiosity to embracing challenges and inspiring others.
